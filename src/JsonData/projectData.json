    "background": "This was my first ever web project done in a group. It was initially supposed to be an experimental project where we focused on practicing javascript along with Git/Github. However, it later expanded into a full fledged project. After the success ofver.Three, the team wanted to dive further into JavaScript. We decided to go with React as the framework of choice and thus began our next project where we recreated/Upgraded Clover.Three using react framework.",
